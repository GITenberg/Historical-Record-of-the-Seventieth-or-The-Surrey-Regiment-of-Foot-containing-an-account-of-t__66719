<p class="noindent">The character and credit of the British Army must
chiefly depend upon the zeal and ardour by which
all who enter into its service are animated, and
consequently it is of the highest importance that any
measure calculated to excite the spirit of emulation,
by which alone great and gallant actions are achieved,
should be adopted.</p>

<p>Nothing can more fully tend to the accomplishment
of this desirable object than a full display of the noble
deeds with which the Military History of our country
abounds. To hold forth these bright examples to
the imitation of the youthful soldier, and thus to
incite him to emulate the meritorious conduct of those
who have preceded him in their honorable career,
are among the motives that have given rise to the
present publication.</p>

<p>The operations of the British Troops are, indeed,
announced in the “London Gazette,” from whence
they are transferred into the public prints: the
achievements of our armies are thus made known at
the time of their occurrence, and receive the tribute<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_iv"></a>[iv]</span>
of praise and admiration to which they are entitled.
On extraordinary occasions, the Houses of Parliament
have been in the habit of conferring on the Commanders,
and the Officers and Troops acting under
their orders, expressions of approbation and of thanks
for their skill and bravery; and these testimonials,
confirmed by the high honour of their Sovereign’s
approbation, constitute the reward which the soldier
most highly prizes.</p>

<p>It has not, however, until late years, been the practice
(which appears to have long prevailed in some of
the Continental armies) for British Regiments to keep
regular records of their services and achievements.
Hence some difficulty has been experienced in obtaining,
particularly from the old Regiments, an authentic
account of their origin and subsequent services.</p>

<p>This defect will now be remedied, in consequence
of His Majesty having been pleased to command
that every Regiment shall, in future, keep a full and
ample record of its services at home and abroad.</p>

<p>From the materials thus collected, the country
will henceforth derive information as to the difficulties
and privations which chequer the career of those who
embrace the military profession. In Great Britain,
where so large a number of persons are devoted to
the active concerns of agriculture, manufactures,
and commerce, and where these pursuits have, for so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_v"></a>[v]</span>
long a period, being undisturbed by the <em>presence of
war</em>, which few other countries have escaped, comparatively
little is known of the vicissitudes of active
service and of the casualties of climate, to which,
even during peace, the British Troops are exposed in
every part of the globe, with little or no interval of
repose.</p>

<p>In their tranquil enjoyment of the blessings which
the country derives from the industry and the enterprise
of the agriculturist and the trader, its happy
inhabitants may be supposed not often to reflect on
the perilous duties of the soldier and the sailor,&mdash;on
their sufferings,&mdash;and on the sacrifice of valuable life,
by which so many national benefits are obtained and
preserved.</p>

<p>The conduct of the British Troops, their valour,
and endurance, have shone conspicuously under great
and trying difficulties; and their character has been
established in Continental warfare by the irresistible
spirit with which they have effected debarkations in
spite of the most formidable opposition, and by the
gallantry and steadiness with which they have maintained
their advantages against superior numbers.</p>

<p>In the official Reports made by the respective Commanders,
ample justice has generally been done to
the gallant exertions of the Corps employed; but
the details of their services and of acts of individual<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span>
bravery can only be fully given in the Annals of the
various Regiments.</p>

<p>These Records are now preparing for publication,
under his Majesty’s special authority, by Mr.
<span class="smcap">Richard Cannon</span>, Principal Clerk of the Adjutant
General’s Office; and while the perusal of them cannot
fail to be useful and interesting to military men
of every rank, it is considered that they will also
afford entertainment and information to the general
reader, particularly to those who may have served in
the Army, or who have relatives in the Service.</p>

<p>There exists in the breasts of most of those who
have served, or are serving, in the Army, an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Esprit
de Corps</i>&mdash;an attachment to everything belonging
to their Regiment; to such persons a narrative of
the services of their own Corps cannot fail to prove
interesting. Authentic accounts of the actions of
the great, the valiant, the loyal, have always been
of paramount interest with a brave and civilized
people. Great Britain has produced a race of heroes
who, in moments of danger and terror, have stood
“firm as the rocks of their native shore:” and when
half the world has been arrayed against them, they
have fought the battles of their Country with unshaken
fortitude. It is presumed that a record of
achievements in war,&mdash;victories so complete and surprising,
gained by our countrymen, our brothers,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vii"></a>[vii]</span>
our fellow citizens in arms,&mdash;a record which revives
the memory of the brave, and brings their gallant
deeds before us,&mdash;will certainly prove acceptable to
the public.</p>

<p>Biographical Memoirs of the Colonels and other
distinguished Officers will be introduced in the
Records of their respective Regiments, and the
Honorary Distinctions which have, from time to
time, been conferred upon each Regiment, as testifying
the value and importance of its services, will be
faithfully set forth.</p>

<p>As a convenient mode of Publication, the Record
of each Regiment will be printed in a distinct number,
so that when the whole shall be completed, the
Parts may be bound up in numerical succession.</p>

<p class="p2 noindent">The natives of Britain have, at all periods, been
celebrated for innate courage and unshaken firmness,
and the national superiority of the British troops
over those of other countries has been evinced in
the midst of the most imminent perils. History contains
so many proofs of extraordinary acts of bravery,
that no doubts can be raised upon the facts which
are recorded. It must therefore be admitted, that
the distinguishing feature of the British soldier is
<span class="smcap">Intrepidity</span>. This quality was evinced by the
inhabitants of England when their country was
invaded by Julius Cæsar with a Roman army, on
which occasion the undaunted Britons rushed into
the sea to attack the Roman soldiers as they descended
from their ships; and, although their discipline
and arms were inferior to those of their
adversaries, yet their fierce and dauntless bearing
intimidated the flower of the Roman troops, including
Cæsar’s favourite tenth legion. Their arms
consisted of spears, short swords, and other weapons
of rude construction. They had chariots, to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x"></a>[x]</span>
axles of which were fastened sharp pieces of iron
resembling scythe-blades, and infantry in long
chariots resembling waggons, who alighted and
fought on foot, and for change of ground, pursuit
or retreat, sprang into the chariot and drove off
with the speed of cavalry. These inventions were,
however, unavailing against Cæsar’s legions: in
the course of time a military system, with discipline
and subordination, was introduced, and
British courage, being thus regulated, was exerted
to the greatest advantage; a full development of
the national character followed, and it shone forth
in all its native brilliancy.</p>

<p>The military force of the Anglo-Saxons consisted
principally of infantry: Thanes, and other men of
property, however, fought on horseback. The
infantry were of two classes, heavy and light.
The former carried large shields armed with spikes,
long broad swords and spears; and the latter were
armed with swords or spears only. They had also
men armed with clubs, others with battle-axes and
javelins.</p>

<p>The feudal troops established by William the
Conqueror consisted (as already stated in the Introduction
to the Cavalry) almost entirely of horse;
but when the warlike barons and knights, with their
trains of tenants and vassals, took the field, a proportion
of men appeared on foot, and, although
these were of inferior degree, they proved stout-hearted
Britons of stanch fidelity. When stipendiary
troops were employed, infantry always constituted
a considerable portion of the military force;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xi"></a>[xi]</span>
and this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">arme</i> has since acquired, in every quarter
of the globe, a celebrity never exceeded by the
armies of any nation at any period.</p>

<p>The weapons carried by the infantry, during the
several reigns succeeding the Conquest, were bows
and arrows, half-pikes, lances, halberds, various
kinds of battle-axes, swords, and daggers. Armour
was worn on the head and body, and in course of
time the practice became general for military men
to be so completely cased in steel, that it was
almost impossible to slay them.</p>

<p>The introduction of the use of gunpowder in the
destructive purposes of war, in the early part of the
fourteenth century, produced a change in the arms
and equipment of the infantry-soldier. Bows and
arrows gave place to various kinds of fire-arms, but
British archers continued formidable adversaries;
and, owing to the inconvenient construction and imperfect
bore of the fire-arms when first introduced,
a body of men, well trained in the use of the bow
from their youth, was considered a valuable acquisition
to every army, even as late as the sixteenth
century.</p>

<p>During a great part of the reign of Queen Elizabeth
each company of infantry usually consisted of
men armed five different ways; in every hundred
men forty were “<em>men-at-arms</em>,” and sixty “<em>shot</em>;”
the “men-at-arms” were ten halberdiers, or battle-axe
men, and thirty pikemen; and the “shot” were
twenty archers, twenty musketeers, and twenty
harquebusiers, and each man carried, besides his
principal weapon, a sword and dagger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xii"></a>[xii]</span></p>

<p>Companies of infantry varied at this period in
numbers from 150 to 300 men; each company had
a colour or ensign, and the mode of formation recommended
by an English military writer (Sir John
Smithe) in 1590 was:&mdash;the colour in the centre of
the company guarded by the halberdiers; the pikemen
in equal proportions, on each flank of the
halberdiers: half the musketeers on each flank of
the pikes; half the archers on each flank of the musketeers,
and the harquebusiers (whose arms were
much lighter than the muskets then in use) in equal
proportions on each flank of the company for skirmishing.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
It was customary to unite a number of companies
into one body, called a <span class="smcap">Regiment</span>, which
frequently amounted to three thousand men: but
each company continued to carry a colour. Numerous
improvements were eventually introduced in the
construction of fire-arms, and, it having been found
impossible to make armour proof against the muskets
then in use (which carried a very heavy ball) without
its being too weighty for the soldier, armour was
gradually laid aside by the infantry in the seventeenth
century: bows and arrows also fell into disuse,
and the infantry were reduced to two classes,
viz.: <em>musketeers</em>, armed with matchlock muskets,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiii"></a>[xiii]</span>
swords, and daggers; and <em>pikemen</em>, armed with pikes
from fourteen to eighteen feet long, and swords.</p>

<p>In the early part of the seventeenth century
Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden, reduced the
strength of regiments to 1000 men. He caused the
gunpowder, which had heretofore been carried in
flasks, or in small wooden bandoliers, each containing
a charge, to be made up into cartridges, and
carried in pouches; and he formed each regiment
into two wings of musketeers, and a centre division
of pikemen. He also adopted the practice of forming
four regiments into a brigade; and the number
of colours was afterwards reduced to three in each
regiment. He formed his columns so compactly that
his infantry could resist the charge of the celebrated
Polish horsemen and Austrian cuirassiers; and his
armies became the admiration of other nations. His
mode of formation was copied by the English,
French, and other European states; but so great
was the prejudice in favour of ancient customs, that
all his improvements were not adopted until near a
century afterwards.</p>

<p>In 1664 King Charles II. raised a corps for sea-service,
styled the Admiral’s regiment. In 1678
each company of 100 men usually consisted of 30
pikemen, 60 musketeers, and 10 men armed with
light firelocks. In this year the King added a company
of men armed with hand grenades to each of
the old British regiments, which was designated the
“grenadier company.” Daggers were so contrived
as to fit in the muzzles of the muskets, and bayonets<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiv"></a>[xiv]</span>
similar to those at present in use were adopted about
twenty years afterwards.</p>

<p>An Ordnance regiment was raised in 1685, by
order of King James II., to guard the artillery, and
was designated the Royal Fusiliers (now 7th Foot).
This corps, and the companies of grenadiers, did
not carry pikes.</p>

<p>King William III. incorporated the Admiral’s
regiment in the second Foot Guards, and raised
two Marine regiments for sea-service. During the
war in this reign, each company of infantry (excepting
the fusiliers and grenadiers) consisted of 14
pikemen and 46 musketeers; the captains carried
pikes; lieutenants, partisans; ensigns, half-pikes;
and serjeants, halberds. After the peace in 1697 the
Marine regiments were disbanded, but were again
formed on the breaking out of the war in 1702.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>During the reign of Queen Anne the pikes were
laid aside, and every infantry soldier was armed
with a musket, bayonet, and sword; the grenadiers
ceased, about the same period, to carry hand grenades;
and the regiments were directed to lay aside
their third colour: the corps of Royal Artillery was
first added to the Army in this reign.</p>

<p>About the year 1745, the men of the battalion
companies of infantry ceased to carry swords; during<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xv"></a>[xv]</span>
the reign of George II. light companies were added
to infantry regiments; and in 1764 a Board of
General Officers recommended that the grenadiers
should lay aside their swords, as that weapon had
never been used during the Seven Years’ War. Since
that period the arms of the infantry soldier have been
limited to the musket and bayonet.</p>

<p>The arms and equipment of the British Troops have
seldom differed materially, since the Conquest, from
those of other European states; and in some respects
the arming has, at certain periods, been allowed to
be inferior to that of the nations with whom they
have had to contend; yet, under this disadvantage,
the bravery and superiority of the British infantry
have been evinced on very many and most trying
occasions, and splendid victories have been gained
over very superior numbers.</p>

<p>Great Britain has produced a race of lion-like
champions who have dared to confront a host of
foes, and have proved themselves valiant with any
arms. At <em>Crecy</em>, King Edward III., at the head of
about 30,000 men, defeated, on the 26th of August,
1346, Philip King of France, whose army is said to
have amounted to 100,000 men; here British valour
encountered veterans of renown:&mdash;the King of Bohemia,
the King of Majorca, and many princes and
nobles were slain, and the French army was routed
and cut to pieces. Ten years afterwards, Edward
Prince of Wales, who was designated the Black
Prince, defeated, at <em>Poictiers</em>, with 14,000 men,
a French army of 60,000 horse, besides infantry,
and took John I., King of France, and his son<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvi"></a>[xvi]</span>
Philip, prisoners. On the 25th of October, 1415,
King Henry V., with an army of about 13,000
men, although greatly exhausted by marches, privations,
and sickness, defeated, at <em>Agincourt</em>, the
Constable of France, at the head of the flower of
the French nobility and an army said to amount to
60,000 men, and gained a complete victory.</p>

<p>During the seventy years’ war between the United
Provinces of the Netherlands and the Spanish monarchy,
which commenced in 1578 and terminated
in 1648, the British infantry in the service of the
States-General were celebrated for their unconquerable
spirit and firmness;<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and in the thirty
years’ war between the Protestant Princes and the
Emperor of Germany, the British Troops in the service
of Sweden and other states were celebrated for
deeds of heroism.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> In the wars of Queen Anne,
the fame of the British army under the great
<span class="smcap">Marlborough</span> was spread throughout the world;
and if we glance at the achievements performed
within the memory of persons now living, there is
abundant proof that the Britons of the present age
are not inferior to their ancestors in the qualities<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvii"></a>[xvii]</span>
which constitute good soldiers. Witness the deeds
of the brave men, of whom there are many now
surviving, who fought in Egypt in 1801, under the
brave Abercromby, and compelled the French army,
which had been vainly styled <em>Invincible</em>, to evacuate
that country; also the services of the gallant
Troops during the arduous campaigns in the Peninsula,
under the immortal <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>; and the
determined stand made by the British Army at
Waterloo, where Napoleon Bonaparte, who had
long been the inveterate enemy of Great Britain,
and had sought and planned her destruction by
every means he could devise, was compelled to
leave his vanquished legions to their fate, and to
place himself at the disposal of the British Government.
These achievements, with others of recent
dates in the distant climes of India, prove that the
same valour and constancy which glowed in the
breasts of the heroes of Crecy, Poictiers, Agincourt,
Blenheim, and Ramilies, continue to animate the
Britons of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>The British Soldier is distinguished for a robust
and muscular frame,&mdash;intrepidity which no danger
can appal,&mdash;unconquerable spirit and resolution,&mdash;patience
in fatigue and privation, and cheerful obedience
to his superiors. These qualities, united with
an excellent system of order and discipline to regulate
and give a skilful direction to the energies and
adventurous spirit of the hero, and a wise selection
of officers of superior talent to command, whose
presence inspires confidence,&mdash;have been the leading
causes of the splendid victories gained by the British<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xviii"></a>[xviii]</span>
arms.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The fame of the deeds of the past and
present generations in the various battle fields where
the robust sons of Albion have fought and conquered,
surrounds the British arms with a halo of glory;
these achievements will live in the page of history to
the end of time.</p>

<p>The records of the several regiments will be found
to contain a detail of facts of an interesting character,
connected with the hardships, sufferings, and gallant
exploits of British soldiers in the various parts of the
world, where the calls of their Country and the commands
of their Sovereign have required them to
proceed in the execution of their duty, whether in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xix"></a>[xix]</span>
active continental operations, or in maintaining colonial
territories in distant and unfavourable climes.</p>

<p>The superiority of the British infantry has been
pre-eminently set forth in the wars of six centuries,
and admitted by the greatest commanders which
Europe has produced. The formations and movements
of this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">arme</i>, as at present practised, while
they are adapted to every species of warfare, and to
all probable situations and circumstances of service,
are calculated to show forth the brilliancy of military
tactics calculated upon mathematical and scientific
principles. Although the movements and evolutions
have been copied from the continental armies, yet
various improvements have from time to time been
introduced, to insure that simplicity and celerity by
which the superiority of the national military character
is maintained. The rank and influence which
Great Britain has attained among the nations of the
world, have in a great measure been purchased by
the valour of the Army, and to persons who have the
welfare of their country at heart, the records of the
several regiments cannot fail to prove interesting.</p>

no occasion has the undaunted valour of British troops ever been more
manifest. At the termination of a severe and harassing march, rendered
necessary by the superiority which the enemy had acquired, and
which had materially impaired the efficiency of the troops, many disadvantages
were to be encountered. These have all been surmounted by
the conduct of the troops themselves; and the enemy has been taught,
that whatever advantages of position or of numbers he may possess, there
is inherent in the British officers and soldiers a bravery that knows not
how to yield,&mdash;that no circumstances can appal,&mdash;and that will ensure
victory, when it is to be obtained by the exertion of any human means.”</p>

<p class="noindent">The repose granted to Europe by the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle
was interrupted by the aggressions, made
by the French, on the British territory in America.
War between the two kingdoms speedily followed;
and a considerable augmentation was made to the
strength of the British army in the winter of 1755, and
in the spring of 1756. On that occasion a second battalion
was added to the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment, then
commanded by Major-General Henry Holmes, and
stationed in Great Britain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1758</div>

<p>In 1758 the second battalion of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>
foot was constituted a regiment, which was numbered
the “<span class="allsmcap">SEVENTIETH</span>” in the British line. It was stationed
in North Britain; its facings were light grey; it contained
in its ranks many men who were natives of Scotland,
particularly of Glasgow, and they were commonly
called the “<span class="smcap">Glasgow greys</span>.”</p>

<p>The colonelcy of the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTIETH</span> regiment was
conferred on Colonel John Parslow, from captain and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
lieut.-colonel in the first foot guards; the lieut.-colonelcy
on Charles Vignoles, from major in the thirty-first
regiment; and the majority on Robert Pigot, senior
captain of the thirty-first. The officers appointed to
the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTIETH</span> regiment were:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">1759<br />1760</div>

<p>From Scotland the regiment was removed to South
Britain, in 1759, and remained there during the seven
years’ war. Colonel Parslow was removed to the fifty-fourth
regiment, in September, 1760, and the colonelcy
of the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTIETH</span> was conferred on Lieut.-Colonel
Cyrus Trapaud, of the Third or Buffs.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1763</div>

<p>Peace having been concluded, the establishment of
the regiment was reduced in 1763; at the same time
it was removed to Ireland.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1764</div>

<p>In 1764 the regiment embarked from Ireland for
the West Indies, where it was stationed ten years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span></p>

<div class="sidenotex">1768</div>

<p>By the Royal Warrant of the 19th December, 1768,
the facings were directed to be <em>black</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1774</div>

<p>The regiment sustained severe loss from the climate
of the West India Islands during the period it was
employed there; and in 1774 it returned to England
much reduced in numbers.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1775<br />1776</div>

<p>During the year 1775 the regiment was employed
recruiting its numbers in England, and in 1776 it
marched to Scotland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1778</div>

<p>The regiment was stationed in Scotland until the
early part of the year 1778, when it embarked for
North America, and was employed in that part of the
British dominions during the remainder of the American
war, which commenced in 1775, and ended in 1782.</p>

<p>Lieut.-General Trapaud was removed in 1778 to
the fifty-second regiment, and was succeeded in the
colonelcy of the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTIETH</span> by Major-General William
Tryon, from major in the first foot guards.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1779<br />1780</div>

<p>The battalion companies of the regiment were stationed
in the northern provinces of America; but the
flank companies were detached southward.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1781</div>

<p>In 1781 the regiment was stationed in Nova Scotia,
and it remained in that country during the two following
years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1782</div>

<p>In 1782, the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTIETH</span> was designated the <span class="allsmcap">SURREY</span>
regiment, county titles being adopted at this period in
the army, pursuant to His Majesty’s command, with a
view of promoting the recruiting service by cultivating
a connexion with distinct parts of the kingdom.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1783</div>

<p>Lieut.-General Tryon was removed, in 1783, to the
twenty-ninth regiment, and King George III. appointed
Colonel the Earl of Suffolk, from the ninety-seventh
(afterwards disbanded) to the colonelcy of the
<span class="allsmcap">SEVENTIETH</span> regiment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span></p>

<div class="sidenotex">1784</div>

<p>Having been relieved from duty in North America,
the regiment returned to England in 1784.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1785<br />1786<br />1787</div>

<p>The regiment occupied various quarters in England
during the years 1785 and 1786, and in 1787 it
proceeded to Ireland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1793</div>

<p>While the regiment was stationed in Ireland, the
French Revolution involved Great Britain in war
with France; and in 1793, the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTIETH</span> regiment
embarked from Ireland, under the command of Colonel
Eyre Coote, for the West Indies, to take part in an
attack on the French West India Islands.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1794</div>

<p>An armament was assembled at Barbadoes in the
beginning of 1794, under the orders of General Sir
Charles, afterwards Earl, Grey, for the capture of
<em>Martinique</em>, and the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTIETH</span> regiment had the
honor to take part in this enterprise. The grenadiers
and light infantry were formed in flank battalions, and
Lieut.-Colonel Coote commanded the first battalion of
light infantry; the regiment was commanded by Lieut.-Colonel
Johnston. A landing was effected, at three
different points, on the island of Martinique on the 5th,
6th, and 8th of February; and the first light infantry,
under Lieut.-Colonel Coote of the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTIETH</span>, distinguished
themselves at the capture of the heights of
Morne le Brun. The battalion companies had also
an opportunity of signalizing themselves. Sir Charles
Grey stated in his despatch,&mdash;“I received intelligence
of the enemy’s landing troops, and taking post on
Morne Pied, to cut off the communication between
Brigadier-General Whyte and head-quarters at Salée,
and I ordered the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTIETH</span> regiment, with two
howitzers, to march on the same night and dislodge
them, which was executed with great spirit, and the
post taken possession of early on the morning of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
9th, under the good conduct of Adjutant-General,
Colonel Dundas, the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTIETH</span> regiment being commanded
by Lieut.-Colonel Johnston, and the enemy
completely defeated at the first charge.” The loss
of the regiment on this occasion was limited to a few
private soldiers wounded.</p>

<p>After a series of brilliant successes, possession was
gained of the greater part of the island; Fort Bourbon
and Fort Royal were besieged, and the garrisons
forced to surrender,&mdash;the French troops in the former
delivering up five stand of colours, and those in the
latter two. These colours were sent to England, and
lodged in St. Paul’s Cathedral by a party of life guards
and foot guards on the 17th of May. Thus the British
flag waved a second time over Martinique, the
island having been captured by the English in 1762,
but restored to France by the peace of Fontainebleau
in the following year.</p>

<p>In these successes of the British arms, in which the
<span class="allsmcap">SEVENTIETH</span> regiment had the honor to share, the
commander of the expedition stated&mdash;“The spirit,
unanimity, and perseverance of the navy and army
never were more conspicuous; nor has more cordial
co-operation ever been manifested between His
Majesty’s naval and land forces. In a word, the
general and field officers, and the commanding
officers of corps, have set such an example of zeal,
activity, and animation in this service, which has
been so laudably imitated by all the officers and
soldiers of this little army, that they merit the
greatest praise.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">1795</div>

<p>Having sustained severe loss from the climate of
the West Indies, the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTIETH</span> regiment returned
to Europe in May, 1795; it was speedily recruited, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
embarked for Gibraltar under the orders of Lieut.-Colonel
Coote.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1796<br />1800</div>

<p>The regiment performed garrison duty at Gibraltar
until February, 1800, when it embarked for the West
Indies; six companies, commanded by Lieut.-Colonel
Arthur Wolfe, arrived at their destination, and were
stationed at Trinidad. The vessel containing four
companies, under Lieut.-Colonel Nichol, sprung a leak
at sea, and put into Lisbon harbour, from whence they
were ordered to proceed to the island of Jersey.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1801</div>

<p>The six companies, which had proceeded to the West
Indies, arrived at Jersey in May, 1801, and the regiment
proceeded to Dover. It was one of the regiments
forming the army of observation at Shornecliff camp
under Major-General (afterwards Sir John) Moore.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1802<br />1803<br />1804<br />1805</div>

<p>Peace was concluded with France in 1802; but
hostilities were resumed in 1803, and in the autumn
of the same year the regiment again embarked for the
West Indies, under Lieut.-Colonel Andrew Ross. It
arrived at its destination in December, and was
stationed at the island of Antigua during the years
1804 and 1805.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1806</div>

<p>In June, 1806, the head-quarters were removed to
St. Christopher, leaving two companies at Antigua,
under Lieut.-Colonel Lewis Grant, for one month, and
they afterwards joined the regiment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1807</div>

<p>The policy of the Court of Denmark having become
favourable to the interests of the French, that country
became involved in war with <ins class="corr" id="tn-6" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'Great Britian'">
Great Britain</ins>, in 1807,
and in December of that year a detachment of the
<span class="allsmcap">SEVENTIETH</span> regiment, under Lieut.-Colonel Ross, embarked
from St. Christopher with the expedition,
under General Henry Bowyer, against the Danish
islands of <em>St. Thomas</em> and <em>St. John</em>, which surrendered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
to the British arms without firing a shot. The regiment
followed the detachment soon afterwards, and was
stationed at the island of St. Thomas.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1808<br />1809</div>

<p>During the years 1808 and 1809 the regiment was stationed
at the island of St. Thomas and its dependencies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1810</div>

<p>In 1810 the flank companies of the regiment were
selected to form part of an expedition, under Lieut.-General
Sir George Beckwith, K.B., against the island
of <em>Guadaloupe</em>, which had been restored to the French at
the peace of Amiens. The expedition arrived before the
island in January, 1810. The troops employed on this
service were formed into two divisions of two brigades
in each: on the 30th of January, Major-General (afterwards
Sir Thomas) Hislop reported, that the enemy
having retained possession of the sea-batteries commanding
the anchorage in the Grande Aine, from which
they continued to fire on the British men of war, the
Light Company of the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTIETH</span> regiment was sent to
dislodge them, which was instantly effected, the party of
the enemy escaping along shore. The conquest of this
important settlement was accomplished in nine days;
the Governor, Captain-General Ernouf, surrendering
the colony and its dependencies to the British arms,
by articles dated the 6th of February.</p>

<p>In June of the same year, the officers, non-commissioned
officers, and drummers of four companies proceeded
to Europe, in order to replace the casualties arising
from a long course of colonial service, and formed a
recruiting depôt, which was established at Ayr, in Scotland,
under the orders of Colonel Andrew Ross. This
officer was placed on the Staff of the army in the following
year, and proceeded to Cadiz, from whence he was
removed to Carthagena, where he died of an illness
brought on by fatigue and service: he attained the
rank of Major-General before his decease.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<div class="sidenotex">1811</div>

<p>From Ayr the depôt was removed, in 1811, to Stirling
Castle, under Lieut.-Colonel Grant.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1812</div>

<p>The regiment was relieved from duty in the West
Indies in the early part of 1812, and, returning to
Europe, joined the depôt at Stirling Castle, in April
and June of that year.</p>

<p>On the 22nd of October, 1812, the Prince Regent,
in the name and on the behalf of His Majesty, was
pleased to approve of the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTIETH</span> being styled
the <span class="smcap">Glasgow lowland regiment</span>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1813</div>

<p>From Stirling Castle the regiment marched in
January, 1813, to Montrose, to assist the magistrates
in suppressing riots: in February it proceeded to Perth,
and performed duty over French prisoners about four
months.</p>

<p>In July the regiment proceeded to Ireland, where
it only remained a few days, before it received orders
to embark for Canada, to reinforce the British troops in
that country in consequence of the war between Great
Britain and the United States. The regiment embarked
from Cork, on the 31st of August, under
Major MacGregor, and, arriving in Lower Canada in
November, was stationed at Quebec.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1814</div>

<p>Lieut.-General the Honorable Sir Galbraith Lowry
Cole, K.B., was appointed Colonel of the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTIETH</span>
regiment, from the 103rd foot, in January, 1814, in
succession to General the Earl of Suffolk, who was
removed to the forty-fourth regiment.</p>

<p>After performing garrison duty at Quebec eight
months, the regiment proceeded to Montreal, from
whence it was removed to Cornwall in Upper Canada,
and in August it was brigaded with the ninth, sixteenth,
and fifty-seventh, under Colonel Grant, on the
line of communication from Montreal to Kingston in
Upper Canada.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span></p>

<div class="sidenotex">1815</div>

<p>Peace was concluded with the United States in 1815,
and in June of that year the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTIETH</span> regiment
was ordered to proceed to Kingston.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1816</div>

<p>Lieut.-General Sir G. Lowry Cole was removed to

in the colonelcy of the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTIETH</span> by Lieut.-General
Forbes Champagné, from colonel-commandant
of a battalion of the Rifle Brigade.</p>

<p>During this year the regiment remained at Kingston,
and Lieut.-Colonel Thomas Evans, C.B., assumed the
command in August.</p>

<p>Lieut.-General Champagné died in the autumn of
the year 1816, and the colonelcy of the regiment was
conferred on Major-General Sir Kenneth Alexander
Howard, K.C.B., afterwards Lord Howard of Effingham.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1817</div>

<p>In April, 1817, the regiment was removed, under
the command of Colonel Grant, to Fort George,
Drummond’s Island, Amherstburg, the posts on the
Niagara frontier, and York, now called Toronto.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1819<br />1820</div>

<p>The regiment was removed to Kingston, in June,
1819, and was stationed at that place, under the command
of Lieut.-Colonel MacGregor; in November,
1820, Colonel Ottley arrived and assumed the command
of the regiment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1821<br />1822</div>

<p>From Kingston the regiment was removed in May,
1821, to Quebec, and in May, 1822, Colonel Ottley
proceeded to Europe on leave, when the command
again devolved on Lieut.-Colonel MacGregor.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1823<br />1824</div>

<p>The regiment continued to occupy quarters in
Canada during the years 1823, 1824, 1825, and 1826.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1825<br />1826</div>

<p>In 1825 the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTIETH</span> was permitted to resume
the County title of the <span class="smcap">Surrey</span> regiment, conferred upon
it in 1782, and to discontinue the title of the Glasgow
Lowland regiment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1827</div>

<p>In the summer of 1827 the regiment was relieved
from duty in Canada, and returning to Europe, arrived
in Ireland in September; it was stationed in that
country six years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1832</div>

<p>The Earl of Effingham was removed to the third
foot in 1832, and the colonelcy of the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTIETH</span> was
conferred on Lieut.-General Gage John Hall, from the
ninety-ninth regiment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1834</div>

<p>After occupying various stations in Ireland until
the spring of 1834, the regiment was divided into six
service, and four depôt companies. The service companies
embarked at Cork in March and April, for
Gibraltar, where they were stationed two years.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1835</div>

<p>In 1835, the depôt companies were removed from
Ireland to South Britain, and were afterwards stationed
at the island of Guernsey.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1836</div>

<p>On the 16th of June, 1836, the service companies
embarked at Gibraltar for Malta, where they landed
on the 3rd of July.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1838</div>

<p>The service companies remained at Malta until
January, 1838, when they embarked for the West
Indies, and were stationed at Barbadoes.</p>

<p>In September of the same year the depôt companies
returned to Ireland. Previously to the depôt companies
quitting Guernsey, the following testimonial of the
Royal Court of the Island was presented to Major White,
complimentary of that portion of the regiment:&mdash;</p>

island. I have now the honor to enclose a copy of
that Act, under the seal of the bailiwick, and to express
the pleasure I feel in transmitting such a testimonial
of the esteem and consideration of the Court
for the regiment, knowing it to be so well merited.</p>

<p>“It only remains for me, in conformity with that
Act, and in the name of the Royal Court, to thank
you, Major White, and, through you, the officers,
non-commissioned officers, and privates of the 70th
regiment, for the uniform tenor of your and their

<p class="p1">From Barbadoes the service companies were removed,
in May, 1841, to Canada, and landed at
Montreal in June. On their embarkation for North
America, Lieutenant-General Maister, commanding in
the West Indies, issued the following General Order,
expressive of his approbation of the appearance of the
Regiment:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Lieutenant-General was much gratified with
his Inspection of the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTIETH</span> regiment this
morning (1st May, 1841) on board Her Majesty’s
troop-ship Sapphire.</p>

<p>“The appearance of the men on board, as well as
of the two companies which the Lieutenant-General
had an opportunity of seeing on shore previous to
their embarkation, reflects much credit upon Major<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
White, the officers, non-commissioned officers, and
soldiers of the corps; and although the Lieutenant-General
had not the opportunity of making his
Inspection so minutely as he could have desired, he
is most willing to believe, that, had he done so, it
would have added to the satisfaction he has experienced.”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">1842<br />1843</div>

<p>The service companies were stationed in Canada
during the year 1842. In May, 1843, they embarked
at Quebec for England, under the command of Lieut.-Colonel
Joseph Kelsall, in Her Majesty’s troop-ship
Resistance; and, landing at Portsmouth on the
24th of June, were afterwards joined by the depôt
companies from Ireland. Previous to leaving Canada
seventy-two men of the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTIETH</span> volunteered for
permanent service to other regiments stationed in
North America. The regiment was moved from Portsmouth,
in September following, to Manchester, from
whence it marched to Leeds in October, with detached
companies to Bradford, Sheffield, Halifax, Huddersfield,
and Keighley.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1844</div>

<p>Lieutenant-Colonel Joseph Kelsall retired on full
pay on the 23rd February, 1844, and was succeeded by
Major Edward James White, who was promoted to
the rank of lieutenant-colonel.</p>

<p>In October, 1844, the regiment returned to Manchester,
where it remained till April following.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1845</div>

<p>In April, 1845, the regiment proceeded to Ireland
and was stationed at Newry, from whence it marched
in September to Dublin. On the 30th December,
1845, Lieut.-Colonel E. J. White retired on full pay,
and Major Thomas Reed was promoted to the lieutenant-colonelcy
of the regiment.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1846</div>

<p>The regiment was removed from Dublin to Templemore
in August, 1846.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1847</div>

<p>On the 1st April, 1847, the regiment was augmented
to an establishment of 57 serjeants, 21 drummers, and
one thousand rank and file. Major William Matthew
Bigge was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-colonel
on the 23rd April, 1847, on the retirement of Lieut.-Colonel
Reed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1848</div>

<p>Events in the East Indies having rendered reinforcements
necessary, the sixty-fourth, <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTIETH</span>, and
eighty-third regiments have been selected for embarkation
for India,&mdash;the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTIETH</span> being ordered to
proceed to the Bengal Presidency, where the regiment
may probably have an opportunity of distinguishing
itself in a more signal, though not less useful, manner
than a long tour of Colonial Service has afforded.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The foregoing statement of the services of the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTIETH</span>
regiment shows the long, and unavoidable,
detention of the corps on West India service, and that
such was the cause of its not having had an opportunity
of sharing in the splendid victories obtained by other
regiments which were engaged in the Continental
wars:&mdash;While the regiment was employed in an apparently
inactive state on Colonial duty, the Government,
and the Commander-in-Chief, were enabled to
send other disposable regiments to combat the enemy
in the Peninsula, and on various expeditions in Europe;
the conquered Islands in the West Indies were consequently
entrusted to a few corps, of which the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTIETH</span>
regiment was one, and on which full reliance
could be placed by the Sovereign, and by the Country.</p>

dying on the 3rd of May, 1801, was buried with military

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Honorable Galbraith Lowry Cole</span> entered the
army in March, 1787, and after serving in the subordinate
commissions, was advanced to the rank of major in 1793, when
the struggle between Great Britain and the revolutionists of
France had commenced; and the progress of the eventful

afterwards disbanded; and in 1799 he was nominated lieut.-colonel
in General Villette’s corps, afterwards disbanded;

afterwards extended to the Peninsula, where he commanded a
division during the campaigns from 1810 to the overthrow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
of Napoleon, Emperor of France, and the restoration of the
Bourbon dynasty in 1814. His distinguished services during
those campaigns are blended with the military annals of the
Peninsula, and the public despatches of the Duke of Wellington
bear testimony of his excellent conduct during many difficult
operations, severely contested battles, and sieges. He received
the local rank of lieut.-general in Spain and Portugal
in 1810; was appointed colonel of the 103rd regiment in
1812; and obtained the rank of lieut.-general in 1813. He

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
